## Hello! I'm Adhesh

An undergrad computer science student@PESU. Welcome to my site!

## What are my interests?

Hmm quite complicated, I build anything that looks cool, so that's that.
I am currently working on: 
- Hive: [Bitcask clone in GoLang](https://github.com/DedLad/hive/)
- Nebula: <span style="color:#689d6a;size=1rem;">x86 OS implemented in Rust (I will be updating a link to it soon)</span>

## Writing

There is a high chance that some work here is incomplete.
<br>Infact this site is quite incomplete.

Why? Well i would never put anything out if I wanted perfection or completion, sounded like a reason for procrastination, so here we are, we move the right direction step by step.

This site serves as a testament to my journey of progress, showcasing my interests and various projects and honestly anything.

## Wait!!

Before we move away from here, let me show you a cool trick.
<br>Ok how about we start by clicking any key on your keyboard. 
<br>OHH! a computer terminal? Yes, lets see what we can do by entering <span style="color:#689d6a;size=1rem;">`help`</span>.

And thats how you can navigate, cool right?
<br>You can close the terminal by clicking <span style="color:#689d6a;size=1rem;">`esc`</span>

<span style="color:#689d6a;size=1rem;">PS</span>: It has tab auto-completion like the terminal you use :0

<span style="color:#689d6a;size=1rem;">PPS</span>: Still trying to get it to work on phones well:/ navbar for the win.
