# Let's start off by defining what this entails.

- This page is meant to be a space for me to track my time as I grow.

- This page is by no means a perfected piece of content, but rather an attempt to record my time.

- Anything from what I am building, or what I am reading all the way to what I ate belongs here (I eat a lot :x ).

# TLDR of 2024.

I have no written records for much of 2024, but as I write this on the last day of 2024, I have come to a conclusion, 2024 was riddled with <span style = "color:#689d6a;">everything</span>.

Ups and downs, just like any other human on this rock, I too had them, from the crazy <span style = "color:#689d6a;">_LFGs_ </span> when a piece of code I wrote worked at 12 in the night, to <span style = "color:#689d6a;">_disappointment_</span> of opening the results tab on PESU app at 12 in the night and more.

But regardless I have learnt a lot, thanks to the most important <span class=accent>主義</span> that I learnt back in 2023.

The places or the oppurtunities I have had feels surreal looking back at it, so surreal that it's as though it was all by fluke, the dice rolled the right number every time.

I guess this is what <span class=accent>Imposter Syndrome</span> is. The feeling of believeing you dont belong to where you stand, is filled to the brim. But no reason to give up, be in a state of bewilderment or be hung up on it. Even if it is true, not a lot of people get a chance to stand where I am, so the only right path is to prove otherwise. 

Well before we run to 2025, thanks to myself (Yes, ofcourse me too), my family and friends, because none of this would've been true without them.

###### But what is <span class=accent>主義</span> you ask?

Hmm well the simple translation of it from Japanese to English is <span class=accent>_*Principle*_</span>, and my principle is 
> <span class=accent>_If I dont challenge myself no one will._</span>

Yes well if I dont challenge myself or even bet on myself no one is going to, there's no choice but to get up and grind, to race <span class=accent>_the me_</span> from yesterday.

At the bottomline, I am more than glad if i can win over the yesterday's me today in any way possible.

Funny enough this was my <span class=accent>_New Year's Resolution_</span> going into 2024. As we approach the end of 2024, I want to start 2025 with a new addition to my <span class=accent>主義</span>.

###### What is it going to be?

> <span class=accent>_Retrace and Repair._</span> 

Record everything that goes wrong, work upon it and fix it.

Leave nothing under the <span class=accent>_gone wrong_</span> column.

Mistakes are proofs that I can optimise more, not a reason for getting hung up on something.

# With that lets start 2025!!

Why is it empty??

Duhh, not even 24 hours has passed by -_-
